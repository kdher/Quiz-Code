This Homework is intended run as a quiz application, to test candidtates on their coding knowledge. For now, we will be scoping, to quiz candidates on JavaScript language alone.

- Create an submit button to kick off questions and timer 
- Add in 6 questions with 4 choices and program in correct choice. 
    - if correct user gets a note saying correct and a sound effect and moves to the next queston 
    - if incorrect, the user loses 10 seconds and a note saying they are incorrect and moves to next question. 

- When questions are complete go to a new screen that says all done, displays final score and asks the user to enter their intials. Final score is how many seconds you have left. 

- When user clicks submit it goes to a new page with all high scores shown as a list and gives you an option to either go back or clear high scores.
